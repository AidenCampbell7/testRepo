      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Aiden Campbell, a Computer Science major at the University of
        South Carolina (Class of 2027). I'm passionate about connecting people
        with technology and am actively seeking an internship – ideally in
        tech sales – where I can combine technical know‑how with strong
        interpersonal skills.

      <!-- Customer Segmentation Explorer showcasing unsupervised machine learning -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Customer Segmentation Explorer</h3>
        <p>
          This interactive tool segments customers into clusters based on metrics
          such as age and annual revenue. You can choose the number of clusters
          and see a scatter plot of customers coloured by their cluster. The
          project demonstrates an implementation of the K‑means algorithm in
          JavaScript and highlights how unsupervised learning can reveal
          meaningful groups for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

        <p>
          An upgraded take on a traditional to‑do list: organise prospective

          them through your pipeline. Add, drag and delete cards to manage your
          pipeline visually. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation,
          persistent state and a drag‑and‑drop interface in vanilla JavaScript.
